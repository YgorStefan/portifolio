## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Projects via JSON instead of DB (simplicity, shared hosting compatibility)
- No queues — synchronous SMTP on contact form (shared hosting constraint)
- PHP pinned to ^8.2 (Hostinger ceiling — verify in hPanel before first deploy)
- Transactional mail provider TBD (confirm Brevo vs Resend free tier before Phase 3)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: PHP pinned to ^8.2 in composer.json for Hostinger shared hosting compatibility (local PHP 8.3 via --ignore-platform-req)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Tailwind v4 CSS-first pattern confirmed: no tailwind.config.js, no postcss.config.js — @tailwindcss/vite handles all configuration
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Exact npm versions pinned: tailwindcss@4.2.2, @tailwindcss/vite@4.2.2, alpinejs@3.15.8, @alpinejs/intersect@3.15.8

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hostinger PHP version ceiling: documented as 8.2 as of Dec 2025 — verify current availability in hPanel before pinning composer.json
- Transactional mail provider not selected: confirm Brevo vs Resend free tier limits and Laravel 12 driver before Phase 3 begins

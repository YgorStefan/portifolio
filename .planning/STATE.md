## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Projects via JSON instead of DB (simplicity, shared hosting compatibility)
- No queues — synchronous SMTP on contact form (shared hosting constraint)
- PHP pinned to ^8.2 (Hostinger ceiling — verify in hPanel before first deploy)
- Transactional mail provider TBD (confirm Brevo vs Resend free tier before Phase 3)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: PHP pinned to ^8.2 in composer.json for Hostinger shared hosting compatibility (local PHP 8.3 via --ignore-platform-req)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Tailwind v4 CSS-first pattern confirmed: no tailwind.config.js, no postcss.config.js — @tailwindcss/vite handles all configuration
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Exact npm versions pinned: tailwindcss@4.2.2, @tailwindcss/vite@4.2.2, alpinejs@3.15.8, @alpinejs/intersect@3.15.8
- [Phase 01-foundation]: SESSION_DRIVER and CACHE_STORE switched to file (SQLite PDO unavailable in dev env — no impact on portfolio)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Blade layout uses @extends/@section/@yield pattern with partials included in master layout
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Strategy A (index.php path rewrite) recommended as default deploy path — works on all Hostinger plans, no SSH required
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Security checklist with .env 403/404 check is a mandatory pre-Phase-4 gate — must pass before any credentials go on server
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Swiper CSS imported in app.js (not app.css) to avoid Tailwind v4 cascade ordering issues
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: AOS.init() and new Swiper() wrapped in DOMContentLoaded — module scope silently fails in Vite builds
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Devicon served from jsDelivr CDN to keep JS bundle size down
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Bio text is a placeholder — user must personalize with real biography before Phase 4 deployment
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: CV download button uses download attribute to force file download instead of browser tab open

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hostinger PHP version ceiling: documented as 8.2 as of Dec 2025 — verify current availability in hPanel before pinning composer.json
- Transactional mail provider not selected: confirm Brevo vs Resend free tier limits and Laravel 12 driver before Phase 3 begins

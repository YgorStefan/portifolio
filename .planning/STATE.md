## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Projects via JSON instead of DB (simplicity, shared hosting compatibility)
- No queues — synchronous SMTP on contact form (shared hosting constraint)
- PHP pinned to ^8.2 (Hostinger ceiling — verify in hPanel before first deploy)
- Transactional mail provider TBD (confirm Brevo vs Resend free tier before Phase 3)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: PHP pinned to ^8.2 in composer.json for Hostinger shared hosting compatibility (local PHP 8.3 via --ignore-platform-req)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Tailwind v4 CSS-first pattern confirmed: no tailwind.config.js, no postcss.config.js — @tailwindcss/vite handles all configuration
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Exact npm versions pinned: tailwindcss@4.2.2, @tailwindcss/vite@4.2.2, alpinejs@3.15.8, @alpinejs/intersect@3.15.8
- [Phase 01-foundation]: SESSION_DRIVER and CACHE_STORE switched to file (SQLite PDO unavailable in dev env — no impact on portfolio)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Blade layout uses @extends/@section/@yield pattern with partials included in master layout
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Strategy A (index.php path rewrite) recommended as default deploy path — works on all Hostinger plans, no SSH required
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Security checklist with .env 403/404 check is a mandatory pre-Phase-4 gate — must pass before any credentials go on server
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Swiper CSS imported in app.js (not app.css) to avoid Tailwind v4 cascade ordering issues
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: AOS.init() and new Swiper() wrapped in DOMContentLoaded — module scope silently fails in Vite builds
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Devicon served from jsDelivr CDN to keep JS bundle size down
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Bio text is a placeholder — user must personalize with real biography before Phase 4 deployment
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: CV download button uses download attribute to force file download instead of browser tab open
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Skills array defined in PortfolioController (not JSON/config) for single edit-point simplicity
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: .swiper-skills selector in blade matches Plan A app.js init target — swiper-pagination placed as sibling of swiper-wrapper per Swiper DOM requirement
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: onerror on card img hides broken image icon — project images are stubs until user supplies real images in public/images/projects/
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: AOS delay capped at min($i * 100, 400) — prevents 600ms+ waits on later project cards
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: group/group-hover Tailwind pattern for projects hover overlay — pure CSS zero JavaScript
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: Contact form action is intentionally empty — Phase 3 adds route, @csrf, and POST method together to avoid CSRF errors on test submits
- [Phase 02-core-ui-sections]: WhatsApp and Email use inline SVG icons — Devicon CDN has no WhatsApp or email envelope icons
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: Synchronous Mail::to()->send() without queues — shared hosting has no queue worker
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: Redirect target is '/#contact' hash URL, not route('home') — keeps user at contact section after submission
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: try/catch wraps mail dispatch only, not validation — ValidationException handled by Laravel auto-redirect
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: Used log mailer in .env for local dev — no real SMTP credentials needed to test locally
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: replyTo on Envelope lets owner reply directly to sender from email client — critical UX for contact form
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: nl2br(e(message)) order is critical: escape first to prevent XSS, then convert newlines to br tags
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: Alpine @submit on form tag (not @click on button) avoids blocking form submission in some browsers
- [Phase 03-contact-form-backend]: old('message') placed between textarea tags (not value attribute) — correct HTML semantics
- [Phase 03]: Auto-advance mode: checkpoint:human-verify auto-approved per orchestrator — all 6 CONTACT requirements verified via route check and build confirmation
- [Phase 04-polish-and-deploy]: og:url usa config('app.url') para resolução via env APP_URL; og:image usa asset() para URL absoluta compatível com redes sociais

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hostinger PHP version ceiling: documented as 8.2 as of Dec 2025 — verify current availability in hPanel before pinning composer.json
- Transactional mail provider not selected: confirm Brevo vs Resend free tier limits and Laravel 12 driver before Phase 3 begins

**Verified:** 2026-03-24
**Status:** human_needed — all automated checks passed; 7 items require live browser verification
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

**Orphaned requirements (Phase 2 plans vs REQUIREMENTS.md):** None — all 23 Phase 2 IDs are accounted for.

**Note on CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-06:** Plan E implements the contact form UI and social links as a prerequisite for Phase 3, and the code is present in home.blade.php. However, REQUIREMENTS.md correctly assigns both to Phase 3 (backend implementation). The contact UI implemented here satisfies the structural part; functional requirements (CONTACT-02 through CONTACT-05) remain Phase 3.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `resources/views/pages/home.blade.php` | 250 | `<form action="" method="POST">` — empty action | INFO | Intentional — Phase 3 wires the route. Form cannot be submitted successfully but renders correctly for Phase 2 visual goal. |
| `resources/views/pages/home.blade.php` | 4 | Comment "Phase 1: section stubs... Phase 2 fills content" | INFO | Harmless comment, not a stub element. |
| `data/projects.json` | all | All 4 project entries are placeholder/sample data | WARNING | User must replace with real project data before deployment. Not blocking for Phase 2 visual goal. |
| `public/images/profile.jpg` | — | Placeholder image (not a real photo) | WARNING | User must replace before deployment. Cards render correctly with placeholder. |
| `public/files/curriculo.pdf` | — | Placeholder PDF | WARNING | User must replace before deployment. Download link resolves. |

No blockers found. All warnings are documented placeholders intentional by design.

### Human Verification Required

All automated checks passed. The following items require a live browser to confirm the Phase 2 visual goal is fully achieved:

#### 1. Dark Theme Visual Consistency

**Test:** Start `php artisan serve`, open http://localhost:8000
**Expected:** All backgrounds are dark (near-black); no white sections; electric-blue accent on buttons, borders, tags, and hover states
**Why human:** Background color rendering and theme token resolution require a rendered browser context

#### 2. Responsive Layout — No Horizontal Overflow

**Test:** Resize browser to 375px, then 768px, then 1280px
**Expected:** No horizontal scrollbar at any viewport width; Hero, About, Contact stack to single column on mobile
**Why human:** Overflow behavior depends on computed CSS which requires a browser layout engine

#### 3. AOS Scroll Animations

**Test:** Scroll slowly through all sections from Hero to Contact
**Expected:** Each section's elements fade/slide in as they enter the viewport (fade-down for hero photo, fade-up for text, fade-right/fade-left for about columns)
**Why human:** AOS fires on IntersectionObserver events — runtime DOM behavior

#### 4. Swiper Skills Carousel

**Test:** Navigate to the Skills section and wait 10 seconds; also try clicking pagination dots and testing on a narrow window
**Expected:** Auto-advances every 3 seconds; dots are clickable; 2 cards visible at 375px, 3 at 640px, 5 at 1024px+
**Why human:** Swiper autoplay and breakpoint behavior require a live browser

#### 5. Project Card Hover Overlay

**Test:** Hover each of the 4 project cards
**Expected:** Semi-transparent dark overlay fades in; "Repositório" button appears on cards with a repo URL; "Em breve" text appears on cards with null url and repo
**Why human:** CSS group-hover transition requires browser interaction

#### 6. Hero CTA Smooth Scroll

**Test:** Click "Entre em Contato" button in the Hero section
**Expected:** Page smooth-scrolls to the Contact section
**Why human:** scroll-smooth behavior and anchor navigation require browser runtime

#### 7. Contact Form Focus Ring

**Test:** Click each form input field (nome, e-mail, assunto, mensagem)
**Expected:** Accent-blue focus ring appears on the active input
**Why human:** CSS :focus styles require browser interaction to trigger

---

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 23 Phase 2 requirement IDs are implemented with substantive code, wired to real data sources, and the production build compiles successfully. The outstanding items are:

1. **Human visual verification** (7 items above) — the automated checks confirm all structural elements exist and are wired correctly, but visual rendering quality, animation behavior, and responsive overflow require a human checkpoint in a live browser.
2. **Placeholder assets** — profile photo, CV PDF, and project images are intentional placeholders per Plan A/D design; these are not gaps but pre-deployment user actions.
3. **Contact form action** — empty `action=""` is intentional; Phase 3 wires the backend route and @csrf token.
